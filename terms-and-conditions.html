          <h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
          <p> Accepted applications to attend the ABSI conference or training course (“Event”) are in every case subject to these terms and conditions:</p>
          <p><b>Payment Terms</b> – Payment is due in full within 5 days of receiving an invoice from <b>ABSI</b> after completion and return of the registration form. Due to limited conference space we advise early registration and payment by credit card to avoid disappointment. <b>ABSI</b> reserves the right to admit or refuse admission to delegates who have not shown proof of payment of conference fees or not agreed to sign an indemnity form.</p>
          <p><b>Speakers</b> - Views of Speakers at any Conference or Training Course – are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABSI, its employees, agents or contractors.</p>
          <p><b>Delegate Substitutions</b> – Provided the fee has been paid in full, within the time frame as per our terms and conditions, substitutions at no extra charge can be made up to 10 working days, before the start of the Event. (Send notification for any such changes in writing for the attention of the Customer Services Manager at absi@gmail.com).</p>
          <p><b>Delegate Cancellations</b> – must be received by ABSI in writing and must be addressed to the Customer Services Manager at absi@gmail.com</p>
          <p>Cancellations received 10 working days before Event start-date, entitle the cancelling delegate to a full credit of amounts (credit to attend future event – not refund monies) paid to date of cancellation which may only be redeemed against the cost of any future ABSI Event, within one year from date of such cancellation;</p>
          <p>Any cancellations received less than 10 working days before the Event start-date, do not entitle the cancelling delegate to any refund or credit note and the full fee must be paid. Nonattendance without written cancellation to the Customer Services Manager is treated as a cancellation with no entitlement to any refund or credit.</p>
          <p><b>Speaker Changes</b> – Occasionally it is necessary for reasons beyond our control to alter the content and timing of the program or the identity of the speakers.</p>
          <p>If ABSI cancels an Event, delegate payments at the date of cancellation will be credited to an ABSI Event (such credit is available for up to one year from the date of cancellation). If ABSI postpones an Event, delegate payments at the postponement date will be credited towards the rescheduled Event. If the delegate is unable to attend the rescheduled Event, the delegate will receive a full credit of amounts paid up to the date of postponement which may only be redeemed against the cost of any future ABSI Event (and such credit will be available for one year from the date of postponement). No cash refunds whatsoever are available for cancellations or postponements.</p>
          <p><b>Indemnity</b> – ABSI is absolved from and indemnified against any loss or damage as a result of substitution, alteration or cancellation/postponement of an Event arising from any cause whatsoever, including, without limitation, any fortuitous event, Act of God, unforeseen occurrence or any other event that renders performance of the Event impracticable or impossible. A “fortuitous event” includes, but is not limited to, war, fire, flood, riot, industrial action, extreme weather or other emergency.</p>
          <p><b>Warranty of Authority</b> – The signatory warrants that he/she has the authority to sign this Application and agrees to be personally liable to ABSI for payments falling due pursuant thereto should such warranty be breached.</p>
